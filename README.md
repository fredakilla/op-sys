# Operator system: accessing parameters in execute handlers

This is the accompanying implementation of my [blog post](http://geidav.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/operator-systems-accessing-parameters-in-execute-handlers/) on accessing parameters in execute handlers in an operator system. The project files are for Visual C++ 2012. Porting the code over to Linux shouldn't be much more than porting the assembly files.
